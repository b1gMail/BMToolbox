The .nsi file uses placeholders (like %%appName%%) which were auto-replaced by
their respective values when generating the toolbox installer from the b1gMail
ACP via the toolbox service hosted as a B1G Software web service.

If you want to build a new toolbox version manually, you need to replace the
values manually before building the setup via NSIS or write some sort of
tool/script to do this for you.
